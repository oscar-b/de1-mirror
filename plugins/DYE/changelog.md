# Changelog - "Describe Your Espresso" Decent DE1 app plugin

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [2.08] - 2021-10-03

### Changed

- Ok button moves to the center of the page 
- Moved all editing actions to a new "Edit data" dialog
- The visualizer button now launches a Visualizer dialog with options for upload, download, browse (direct or QR),
and see visualizer settings or enable visualizer
- Shots that are not saved to history now are shown with a message and all fields disabled, instead of showing
an error page as before. The old way closed the DYE page and prevented moving to other shots, which now is possible.
- Disabled dclickers or draters background colors now transparent

## [2.00] - 2021-04-29

### Added
- New navigation menu on the main DYE page (top left) allow to move through the shot history. Specially useful under the Insight skin as it has no history viewer.

### Changed
- Migrated from a DSx plugin to a DE1app plugin. Could now potentially work with any skin, though currently it's only integrated with Insight, DSx and MimojaCafe.
- Namespaces GUI, IS, and NUME split-off to the new 'de1_dui' package integrated in the DE1app core app. GUI building now uses the DUI framework.

- Listboxes now scroll correctly until the final elements.
- Size of text-based widgets like listboxes has been fixed to reduce collisions with other widgets when user changes font size.
- comes_from_sleep no longer needed in DE::load_page, now uses the more general mechanism 'previous_page'.

## [1.18] - [Unreleased]

### Added
- Completed the parametrization of the aspect. Now a different set of backgrounds, fonts, and colors can be defined
per skin/theme. All images used in buttons have been replaced by Fontawesome icons or canvas items.

## [1.17] - 2021-02-08

### Added
- Enable Visualizer auto-upload. "Upload to Visualizer" button on the main DYE page now toggles to 
"Re-Upload to Visualizer" instead of "See in Visualizer". New settings "auto_upload_to_visualizer" (default 0)
and "min_seconds_visualizer_auto_upload" (default 6), which can be set from the DYE Settings page.
Requested from @Miha Rehar, @TMC and @Jakub Olesky.
- Visualizer password is now hidden by default, this can be changed tapping the "eye" icon on its right.

## [1.16] - 2021-02-06

### Added
- New plugin auto-update system from GitHub latest release (suggested by @TMC)
- New ::DYE::TXT page for single-page text entry (or just showing text if read-only).

### Changed
- Solved bug that settings initialized to an empty string were not being stored into DYE_settings.tdb.
- Solved bug reported by @Idan that having never put a chart on the right side of the History Viewer could raise
a runtime error in proc ::DYE::define_past_shot_desc2 when tapping on the "Temperature on/off" button.

## [1.14] - 2021-02-03

### Added
- New settings "last_shot_DSx_home_coords" and "next_shot_DSx_home_coords" to allow user-positioning or disabling of each shot desc & icon in the DSx home page. Specially useful for the new user-customizable DSx home page. 
- New page ::DYE::NUME to edit numeric values with an in-screen numeric pad, clicker arrows and past values.
Invoked by double tapping on any DYE numeric entry field. 

### Changed
- "Reset" button on Filter Shot History page wasn't clearing enjoyment ratings when they were showing as stars.
- Change all calls to opening pages to use "page_to_show_when_off", as suggested by John. Also start to use context 
actions for the DYE::DE page.
- Remove all borg spinner calls on page_load procs, that were causing the android bar to appear.
- Finished migration of all pages drawing (setup_ui procs) to use the GUI framework.
- Qualify every single proc declaration with its full namespace. 
- All pages names are now the full namespace, so all GUI functions have been simplified and adapted for it.
- GUI add_* commands now should work with any page, either from DYE or not. If the given page name does not start by "::" and does not have a "widgets" array, no attempt is done to add to its widgets collection.
- Reordering of code. Move general generic DE functions and data/variables to ::DYE.

## [1.13] - 2021-01-27
- New DB Schema version 4.
- Patches bug when grinder_dose_weight was empty or zero in the database, V_shot.shot_desc was NULL.
Also works if profile_title is empty (very first 2016 shot files), doesn't add '@' if there's no grinder setting,
and gets back TDS,EY & Enjoyment in shot descs.
- Make next not be emptied if propagation is disabled (suggested by Damian)
- Changed "focus .can" in hide_android_keyboard as suggested by Damian.
- Force hiding the android bar immediately on every page change.

## [1.12] - 2021-01-25
- Patches bug detected by Damian that restarting the app after changing next shot description loses the next shot 
description.

## [1.11] - 2021-01-24
- Patches bugs detected by @Jason C that changing the profile for next shot, then editing last shot, overwrites the 
wrong next profile on last shot file.
Essentially I shouldn't be calling ::save_espresso_rating_to_history in DYE::DE::save_description.  

## [1.10] - 2021-01-23
- Patches minor bugs introduced in 1.09.
    * Cup icon from screensaver was waking up the DE1 (reported by  Robert Fickel Robert )
    * Clickable area for the arrows in the EY & TDS fields was oversized.
    * EY & TDS fields had their maximum values swapped. 

## [1.09] - 2021-01-21
- New configuration page. Allows setting all plugin options, manage the database, and shows the status of last 
  Visualizer upload and last DB sync. All changes apply dymically, no need to restart the app.
- Better handling of Visualizer upload errors. Last result shown on the DYE settings page.
- Database storage of chart series is now done in a single SQL statement per shot, which is 60x faster, so enabling it is now perfectly feasible.
- Full synch of database to history and history_archive folders on every startup, detecting every added, modified, 
removed or archived shots (no longer "fast-check").
- Shots manually removed from the history and history_archive are still kept in the database, but no longer appear in  searches.
- Better formed shot description strings in listboxes, now unified coming from a DB view. No more empty " - " or " @ ". parts, and the ratio is shown.  
- Corrected runtime error when tapping the cup icon on the sleepsaver page and there is no chart on the DSx home page. Reported by Pedro Ponce de Le√≥n. 	Profited to improve how DE::load_page handles, now returns 0 or 1, and an 
informative message is shown if the description could not be loaded. 
- Usability improvement: When a category is empty (often for first-time users), shows a message explaining that it 
gets filled from current & past description data. Coming from bug report by Jakub Oleksy.
- Usability improvement: Tapping "Cancel" on the main DYE page now checks if some data has been modified and if it 
has, it ask for user confirmation before cancelling. 
- Usability improvement: UI elements that are disabled are now homogeneous (same color, apply to all labels & images)
- Added "hide_android_keyboard" as the final line of every load_page proc.
- Introduce new GUI namespace to encapsulate GUI code like widgets creation, parameterization of aspect variables
 	(colors, fonts, etc.) This should facilitate future migration to DE1 extension system.
- Parameterization of metadata fields in a data dictionary (not in use yet)
- More runtime info (mainly SQL) written to log.txt file if log is activated, which should facilitate bug solving. 
- New database initialization procedure "DB::init" and other DB-related code refactorings.
- load_shot refactored to simplify code
- If on Android, check there's wifi before launching Visualizer upload. If not, tells the user.
- Fails if you try to use a database schema version higher that the used by the current version of the plugin.
- New star-ratings optional UI to enter and search Enjoyment. Suggested by Damian. Activated by default, can revert 
to previous system in the settings page.
- Parameterization of metadata fields in a data dictionary (USE) 	 
- New field "drinker_name" in the People section.

## [1.08] - 2021-01-16
- Patches 2 bugs introduced in 1.07:
    * Runtime error when Visualizer credentials are not introduced in DYE_settings.tdb
    * Runtime error for invoking http::cleanup on the catch of the main request 

## [1.07] - 2021-01-15
- Correct bug spotted by @Andreas D'Hollandere on first run of DSx+DYE or removal of DSx_settings.tdb:
- Tests all DSx_settings/settings variables exist in reset_gui_starting_espresso_leave_hook, to prevent error on 
first-time installs or accidental removal of settings.tdb/DSx_settings.tdb
- Check existance of ::DSx_settings(live_graph_time) to enter the DYE_describe_espresso page for "current", to 
prevent error on first-time installs or accidental removal of settings.tdb/DSx_settings.tdb
- Check existance of ::DSx_settings(past_file_name(2)) to enter the DYE_describe_espresso page for "past" or 
"past2" in History Viewer, to prevent error on first-time installs or accidental removal of settings.tdb/DSx_settings.tdb
- Requires DSx 4.39
- Visualizer integration!!!
- Corrected bug reported by @Jakub Oleksy that tapping on a category dropdwon without actual values would freeze the application (missing "borg spinner off" when returning early from IS::load_page)

## [1.06] - 2021-01-14
- Corrects version 1.05 bug that produced a "unable to open database file" error (due to using [history] instead of [homedir])
- Declares 1.06 version according to DSx 4.38 new versioning system.

## [1.05] - 2021-01-14
- New dropdown for grinder setting, shows per-grinder model past settings (requested by Ed Laufer), sorted 
lexicographically (unlike other categories that are sorted by last used)
- All description fields now have whitespace trimmed (requested by Ed Laufer)
- If the database file from the DYE_settings is not found at startup, it is reset to its default value. Also now
the relative instead of the absolute path is stored, preventing "Unable to open database" errors when DYE_settings 
are moved from tablet to computer and viceversa (related to bug reported by Bob Stern) 
- Corrected bug using settings(espresso_clock) which may be undefined in a new install. Also, set the shot data(clock) in DE::load_description(), and remove 'clock' from extra_shot_fields (related to bug reported by Bob Stern)
- Listbox to select previous shots to import its description data now only shows shots with some data actually filled.
- "Dropdown" categories (roaster, beans, etc.) item selection page now shows the currently selected value in the 
description page even if it's new one and not yet added to the database.
- Checks the minimum required versions of both DE1app and DSx are installed, otherwise fails on startup.

## [1.04] - 2021-01-12
- Make setting propagate_previous_shot_desc=0 work correctly (bug reported by Robert Fickel)
- Added GPLv3 license mention in the source code header.

## [1.03] - 2021-01-09
- Solve runtime error when modifying a category in a file that has been manually removed from the history folder.
- Solve runtime error in the History Viewer when filters have been set that select a file that is indexed in the 
database but has been removed from the history/history_archive folder.

## [1.02] - 2020-12-26
- Many internal changes, including bugs fixes and a complete refactoring of the code to use namespaces.
- Dose and drink weight fields now appear in the "Describe your espresso" page for users that don't use a bluetooth 
scale (request from Idan)
- The propagation of descriptive data from one shot to the next one is now under user control (request from Roger Jordan)
 - The page for selecting past entered categories gains two new textboxes, one on top for filtering the shown 
categories, and one on bottom to bulk-modify existing values throughout the whole history.

## [1.00] - 2020-12-16
- New "Describe your espresso" page for editing basic shot metadata in a single page, with the possibility of 
recovering previously typed values of all categories from listboxes in the new "Item select" page.
- Allows describing both the last and next shots from the home DSx page, and any past shot from the History Viewer.
- Shows shot summary descriptions (beans, grinder and extraction) for next and last shots in the home DSx page, and 
for shots selected in both left and right sides of the History Viewer.
- New "Filter shot history" page to filter and sort the shots being shown in the History Viewer by different criteria.
- Icon in the scrensaver page to allow rating your last shot without waking up the DE1.
