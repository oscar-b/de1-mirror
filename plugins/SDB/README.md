# "Shot DataBase" DE1app plugin
A DE1app plugin to store the shot history in your Decent Espresso machine in a SQLite database.

SDB is a spin-off of the [Describe Your Espresso](https://github.com/ebengoechea/dye_de1app_dsx_plugin) DSx plugin 
created so that third-party code can (re)use just the database functionality.

SDB is bundled with the DE1app. Enable it on the extensions page (Settings > App > Extensions > SDB).
To install manually, copy the repository contents to your tablet folder **de1plus/plugins/SDB**.

The plugin offers 3 main features:

1. Keep a SQLite database synchronized with your shot history.

2. Shot metadata dictionary.

3. Functions to open and modify past history shot files.

For details, see the [manual](https://3.basecamp.com/3671212/buckets/7351439/documents/3469016661) available on Decent Diaspora (Decent users only).
