profile_notes {This is a very easy espresso to successfully make and is suggested if you are having difficulty making good drinks.  The pressure rises to only 6 bar and then slowly descends to 4 bar.  The resulting espresso should be free of channeling, have low acidity and quite pleasant to drink straight or with milk.}
